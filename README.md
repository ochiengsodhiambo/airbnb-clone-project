# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
The **airbnb-clone-project** is a full-stack application that replicates core features of the Airbnb platform,
including user authentication, property listings, booking functionality, and interactive maps. 
The project is intended as a hands-on exercise to practice modern web development skills and geospatial data integration.

## Goals
- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


##  Team Roles
- **Product Owner (PO)** – Defines project vision and goals, manages backlog, and ensures alignment with user needs and priorities.  
- **Business Analyst (BA)** – Bridges between vision and implementation: translates requirements into technical specifications, clarifies workflows and user needs.  
- **Project Manager (PM)** – Plans roadmap, allocates resources, tracks progress, manages timelines and deliverables.  
- **UI/UX Designer** – Designs user journey and interface—wireframes, prototypes, usability testing—for intuitive and cohesive experiences.  
- **Software Architect** – Leads high-level system design, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.  
- **Software Developers (Frontend & Backend)** – Write, test, and maintain code. Frontend focuses on UI and interactions; backend focuses on API, business logic, and database operations.  
- **QA Engineer / Tester** – Ensures software quality through testing and verification, aligns product with user and technical expectations.  
- **DevOps Engineer** *(optional depending on scale)* – Manages infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, deployment, and reliability.

## Feature Breakdown
# User Management
This feature provides secure registration, authentication, and profile management for guests, hosts, and admins. It ensures users can safely access their accounts, manage their personal information, and interact with the platform according to their roles.

# Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and retrieve property listings with details such as descriptions, locations, and pricing. This enables the platform to showcase available rentals to guests in a structured and searchable way.

# Booking System
Guests can reserve properties by specifying dates, number of guests, and other booking details. This system manages availability, prevents conflicts, and ensures smooth scheduling between hosts and guests.

# Payment Processing
A secure payment integration allows guests to complete transactions for bookings using methods such as credit cards or PayPal/Stripe. It records payment details, ensures financial accountability, and improves user trust.

# Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in, helping future users make informed decisions. This feature adds transparency, builds trust, and creates a feedback loop for hosts to improve their listings.

# Data Optimization
Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms (e.g., indexing, caching, and query optimization) ensure the platform runs smoothly under heavy usage. This feature improves scalability and guarantees quick responses to user requests.
