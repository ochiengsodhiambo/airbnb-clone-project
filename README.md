# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
The **airbnb-clone-project** is a full-stack application that replicates core features of the Airbnb platform,
including user authentication, property listings, booking functionality, and interactive maps. 
The project is intended as a hands-on exercise to practice modern web development skills and geospatial data integration.

## Goals
- Build a scalable and responsive Airbnb-style web application.
- Practice full-stack development using modern frameworks and tools.
- Integrate interactive maps and location-based features (with support for other spatial APIs).
- Strengthen understanding of database design, API development, and UI/UX best practices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox or Leaflet for maps
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with PostGIS for spatial data) or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: NextAuth / JWT
- **Geospatial Tools**: Mapbox API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render/Heroku/Docker (backend)

##  Team Roles
- **Product Owner (PO)** – Defines project vision and goals, manages backlog, and ensures alignment with user needs and priorities.  
- **Business Analyst (BA)** – Bridges between vision and implementation: translates requirements into technical specifications, clarifies workflows and user needs.  
- **Project Manager (PM)** – Plans roadmap, allocates resources, tracks progress, manages timelines and deliverables.  
- **UI/UX Designer** – Designs user journey and interface—wireframes, prototypes, usability testing—for intuitive and cohesive experiences.  
- **Software Architect** – Leads high-level system design, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.  
- **Software Developers (Frontend & Backend)** – Write, test, and maintain code. Frontend focuses on UI and interactions; backend focuses on API, business logic, and database operations.  
- **QA Engineer / Tester** – Ensures software quality through testing and verification, aligns product with user and technical expectations.  
- **DevOps Engineer** *(optional depending on scale)* – Manages infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, deployment, and reliability.
