# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
The **airbnb-clone-project** is a full-stack application that replicates core features of the Airbnb platform,
including user authentication, property listings, booking functionality, and interactive maps. 
The project is intended as a hands-on exercise to practice modern web development skills and geospatial data integration.

## Goals
- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


##  Team Roles

A user (guest) can make multiple bookings.
A user can leave multiple reviews.
A user can make multiple payments.

## 2. Property
Represents a rental listing created by a host.
Fields:
id – unique identifier
title – name of the property (e.g., "Cozy Beach House")
description – detailed description
location – address or coordinates (can be PostGIS field)
price_per_night – rental price

# Relationships:
A property belongs to a user (host).
A property can have multiple bookings.
A property can have multiple reviews.

## 3. Booking
Represents a reservation made by a guest for a property.
Fields:
id – unique identifier
check_in_date – start date of stay
check_out_date – end date of stay
status – pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed
total_price – calculated cost of the booking

# Relationships:
A booking belongs to a user (guest).
A booking belongs to a property.
A booking can be associated with one payment.

## 4. Review
Represents feedback left by a guest about a property.
Fields:
id – unique identifier
rating – numeric value (e.g., 1–5 stars)
comment – guest’s written feedback
created_at – timestamp of review

# Relationships:
A review belongs to a user (guest).
A review belongs to a property.

## 5. Payment
Represents a financial transaction for a booking.
Fields:
id – unique identifier
amount – payment amount
payment_method – e.g., credit card, PayPal, Stripe
status – pending, successful, failed, refunded
transaction_date – date/time of payment

# Relationships:
A payment belongs to a booking.
A payment is linked to a user (guest).

## Feature Breakdown
# User Management
This feature provides secure registration, authentication, and profile management for guests, hosts, and admins. It ensures users can safely access their accounts, manage their personal information, and interact with the platform according to their roles.

# Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and retrieve property listings with details such as descriptions, locations, and pricing. This enables the platform to showcase available rentals to guests in a structured and searchable way.

# Booking System
Guests can reserve properties by specifying dates, number of guests, and other booking details. This system manages availability, prevents conflicts, and ensures smooth scheduling between hosts and guests.

# Payment Processing
A secure payment integration allows guests to complete transactions for bookings using methods such as credit cards or PayPal/Stripe. It records payment details, ensures financial accountability, and improves user trust.

# Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in, helping future users make informed decisions. This feature adds transparency, builds trust, and creates a feedback loop for hosts to improve their listings.

# Data Optimization
Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms (e.g., indexing, caching, and query optimization) ensure the platform runs smoothly under heavy usage. This feature improves scalability and guarantees quick responses to user requests.

## API Security
# 1. Authentication
What: Use secure authentication protocols (e.g., JWT or OAuth2) with strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt/Argon2) and optional multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Why it’s crucial: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access, ensuring sensitive data like personal info and booking history remain private.

# 2. Authorization
What: Implement role-based access control (RBAC), so different roles (guest, host, admin) only access permitted resources and actions.
Why it’s crucial: Prevents unauthorized users (e.g., guests) from performing admin or host-only actions such as managing other users’ properties or viewing restricted data.

# 3. Data Encryption
What: Use HTTPS/TLS for data in transit and encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., payment details, passwords).
Why it’s crucial: Protects user information and financial details from being intercepted or leaked, maintaining trust in the platform.

# 4. Secure Payments
What: Integrate with trusted payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that comply with PCI DSS standards, and never store raw credit card details in the system.
Why it’s crucial: Reduces liability, prevents financial fraud, and ensures user confidence in booking transactions.

# 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
What: Validate all user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
Why it’s crucial: Ensures attackers cannot manipulate queries, inject scripts, or exploit vulnerabilities to gain access or corrupt data.

# 6. Rate Limiting & Throttling
What: Apply request throttling (e.g., via Redis or Django REST Framework throttling) to prevent brute-force attacks and API abuse.
Why it’s crucial: Protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, credential stuffing, and prevents excessive resource consumption by malicious actors.

# 7. Logging & Monitoring
What: Implement centralized logging and monitoring tools to detect suspicious activities, failed login attempts, and unusual API usage.
Why it’s crucial: Enables quick detection and response to security breaches, helping minimize potential damage.

# 8. Data Privacy & Compliance
What: Follow GDPR-like principles by allowing users to manage their personal data, consent to usage, and request deletion when needed.
Why it’s crucial: Builds trust with users and ensures the platform can operate legally in regions with strict data protection laws.
